# GoogleSpreadsheetCalendar
Create a calendar in Google Sheets. Wanted to embed a simple calendar view in Google Docs, to keep track of project plans. Turns out that is harder than i thought. Quite a few "templates out there". But some are paid, others are partially done, or static.

@todo: Might add more params, like starting month, and also the ability to do just a single mothe etc. Please reach out if you need other features.
